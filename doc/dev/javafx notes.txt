	fxml controller variable injection
---------------------------------------------------

Calling this method...

FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource(".fxml | .css"));

Will load that file's values, and make a new instance of the controller class specified in that fxml file
The values from the fxml file's elements are then injected into the variables in that controller class that
have the @FXML annotation above them. The initialize() method is then called in that class

!IMPORTANT!

These values MUST NOT be static (static values are not instance bounded)
Must have the @FXML annotation prefixing them
The class must implement Initializable
